/**
 * The synchronous half of the approval seam: a command table first, a human second.
 *
 * The order is the whole design. A rule can only ever end the question early in one of two ways -
 * deny, which refuses, or allow, which proceeds without asking - and anything the table has nothing
 * to say about goes to whoever is connected. With nobody connected the answer is `unavailable`,
 * which the kernel reads as a refusal.
