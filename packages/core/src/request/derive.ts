 * the only place that spends it and takes the rest on the caller's word.
 *
 * The nonce is **public**, not secret. It is stamped on the `request/header` row, so anything that
 * reads the ledger — a session-history tool, a transcript file — can hand it to a payload; and
 * `headerEquals` obliges a resume or a retry to carry the same nonce forward, so it is session-lived
 * rather than per-request. What defends the envelope is therefore not the nonce's secrecy but the
 * scrub: a payload cannot write a tag of *any* id, known or guessed, because the scrub eats every

// yet a tag, so a pattern that required a `>` passed it through, and then concatenating the real
// closing delimiter supplied the missing `>` and fused payload and harness delimiter into one
// opening tag that had swallowed the closer; the region never visibly closed and every later
// message read as untrusted data.
//
// The prefix alternative consumes only the `<`, by lookahead. Consuming the run instead deletes
// from `<untrusted` to wherever the run is declared to end, and on the trusted paths that is a
// content-deletion primitive rather than a defence: one AGENTS.md entry ending `<untrusted`
// swallowed every later harness instruction, a summary history was truncated from its first
// `<untrusted`, and the runtime-context blob was left as syntactically invalid JSON. Neutralising
// the `<` alone breaks the fusion just as completely — the payload's `<` no longer exists to meet
// the harness's `>` — and keeps the prose that followed it.
//
// **The bound lives in the first alternative's negative lookahead, and that is the whole of it.**
// `(?![^>\n]{0,200}>)` asks whether a `>` is reachable on this line within 200 characters. If it is
// not, the first alternative wins and takes the single `<`; the second is never tried. `[^>\n]`
// rather than `[^>]`, because `.`-like classes match newlines and a run reaching for a `>` on a
// later line deletes every line between — an AGENTS.md generic two entries down used to delete the
// instruction between. `{0,200}` rather than `*`, because a tag whose attributes run past 200
// characters is not a tag anyone writes, and past the bound the text is prose.
//
// The second alternative repeats the same class and bound so the two read as one run, but they are
// **redundant there** and stated as such rather than left to look load-bearing: it only ever runs
// when the lookahead has already found a `>` on this line within the bound, and the nearest `>` in
// the string is then that one, so `[^>]*` would match the same span. Mutating that half alone fails
// nothing, and a comment claiming otherwise would be the exception-list failure over again.
//
// So the largest span this pattern can delete is one tag on one line, and everything a payload can
// do to widen it — a newline, a longer run, a `>` further down the file — moves it to the first
// alternative, which takes one character. Suppression is the failure mode here (see the suppression
// class in the tests), and it is bounded by construction rather than by the fixtures happening to
// hold no later `>`. What is *not* bounded away is a complete tag inside one line of prose: that
// span is still replaced whole, because the same characters are a tag to delete and prose to keep
// and no pattern can tell. The one place that mattered — the runtime-context blob, one line by
// construction — is fixed below by scrubbing its values before they are serialised.
//
// The two alternatives are exhaustive and disjoint: after `<...untrusted` either a `>` follows on
// the same line within the bound (second) or it does not (first), so no tag-shaped run falls
// between them and none is matched by both.

 * write, ending the envelope early and leaving the rest of the tool output reading as harness text.
 *
 * **`bytes` makes the end computed rather than scanned.** `N` is the length in UTF-8 bytes of the
 * scrubbed payload — the span from the character after the opening delimiter's final `>` to the
 * character before the closing delimiter's first `<`, delimiters themselves excluded. A reader that
 * counts N bytes finds the region's end without looking at a single byte the attacker wrote, so an
 * absorbed, forged or truncated closing delimiter cannot move it; and a tool result clipped by a
 * size limit mid-region is detectable rather than silently unterminated, because fewer than N bytes
 * remain. The scrub is what stops the payload writing a delimiter; the count is what stops it
 * *eating* one.
 *
 * **The id is per region, not per node.** One node can render as several blocks, and two adjacent
 * envelopes sharing an id let a reader that pairs delimiters by id — which is exactly what the rule
 * section tells the model to do — pair the first opener with the second closer, swallow the closer
 * and opener between them as body, and measure a span far longer than the first opener's count. The
 * rule's next sentence then fires and the model is told to distrust entirely benign content. The
 * `block` index is what keeps each region's pair unambiguous.
 *
 * **Who reads `N`, and on which bytes.** Nothing in this package parses it; core hands the string
 * on and has no view of what happens to it afterwards. The reader is the **provider adapter** — the
 * last stage holding the assembled text and the first that must decide what a region is. It should
 * re-measure each region against its declared `N` before serialising and refuse to send on a
 * mismatch. It must measure the **exact bytes it ships**: no stage between here and there may
 * normalise, re-encode or transcode the text, because normalisation moves the true length by an
 * amount the payload picks — an NFD span declaring 30 is truly 30 and is 20 in NFC — which turns a
 * faithful count into a wrong one. Nothing normalises today; this is the condition on keeping it
 * that way. Until the adapter reads it, `N` is advisory, and its standing value is as a truncation
 * signal: a result clipped mid-region leaves fewer than `N` bytes rather than looking unterminated.

  // Exceptions, each because the value cannot carry an escape rather than because it looked safe:
  //   - `sections[0].text`, the rule section — it quotes the delimiter it defines.
  //   - the delimiters `wrapUntrusted` writes — core writes them, after the scrub, by construction.
  //   - `nonce` — `NONCE_PATTERN` admits only lowercase hex, so it holds no `<`, `>`, `|` or quote.
  //   - `messages[].role` — a closed literal union core writes; a literal in every branch below,
  //     never a value it forwards.
  //   - `kind` — a closed literal union core *does* forward, from `DeriveInput`. It is excused by
  //     `assertKind` at the top of this function, not by the type: the union is erased at run time,
  //     and this value is also hashed into `prompt_prefix_hash`. Remove that check and the
  //     exception stops being true.
  //   - `messages[].toolCalls[]` is populated and scrubbed in all three fields, above.
  //   - the summary bridge line — a core constant holding no `<`, `>` or `|`, so it is already a
  //     fixed point of the scrub rather than an exception to it.
  // `samplingParams.thinking` is populated only from the closed input level above; other
  // sampling fields, `maxTokens`, and `metadata` are not populated by this function. Whatever
  // fills one of them owes it the same treatment.
  //
  // **What the walk enforces, exactly.** It walks the minted body and fails on any string that is
  // not a fixed point of the scrub, so it reaches new fields — including into arrays and union
  // members — without anyone having to remember them. But a field is only caught if the *input* it
  // is minted from is hostile, and the test poisons inputs, not fields: a new field fed from a
  // value that is already a scrub fixed point passes silently. So the enumeration moved one level
  // up rather than disappearing — from "list the body's fields" to "poison every string input" —
  // and the test poisons every string in its `DeriveInput` for that reason. All four escapes found
  // so far came from inputs that are poisoned, so there is no live gap; there is a standing
  // obligation on whoever adds an input, which is a smaller thing to remember and is stated here

/**
 * Whether two stamps describe the same request. The nonce is not compared — it is per turn, not per
 * request — and neither are the fields the provider fills in afterwards.
 *
 * Nonce-independent only while no untrusted node is on the surface: `derived_hash` covers
 * `messages`, and every wrapped node's text carries the id. Re-deriving one turn under a fresh
 * nonce therefore compares unequal. Whatever re-derives — resume, a retried attempt — must carry
 * that turn's nonce forward rather than mint a new one; excluding envelope text from the hash would
 * instead stop the hash covering the injected content it exists to cover.
 *
 * Recorded, not decided here: carrying the nonce forward is what makes it session-lived, and a
 * session-lived nonce stamped on the ledger is a public value (see NONCE_PATTERN). The two are one
 * decision — how long a nonce lives, and what it is allowed to be worth — and belong to whoever
 * rules on resume. Nothing in this file may be written as if the nonce were secret.
