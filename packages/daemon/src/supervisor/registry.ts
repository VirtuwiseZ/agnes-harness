   * mid-`acquire()` when *any* resource snapshot commits was never a candidate for the lightweight
   * notification in the first place (it has no registered activation link yet, so it cannot appear in

   *
   * The two concerns are genuinely independent and must not be coupled: which live sessions need
   * retiring depends on whose lightweight `resource.stale` notice failed to deliver, while
   * `openFresh`'s fence protects a worker that is mid-`acquire()` - already spawned, its snapshot
   * file already read, no hello yet - which by definition appears in neither the delivered nor the
   * failed set and so can never be named in a retirement call. Before this existed the bump only ever
   * happened inside `markForResourceRetirement`, i.e. only when some session's notice had failed, so
