/**
 * Fans a server-initiated event out to every connection that has standing to hear it, over
 * whatever endpoints happen to exist at emit time (`endpoints()` is read fresh each call, not
 * captured once, so a connection that attaches or disconnects between two emits is picked up
 * without this class needing to be told). `shutting_down` is the one kind with no session of its
 * own to route by, so it goes to everyone; every other kind is session-scoped and only reaches a
 * connection that is actually attached to that session - a connection that never attached has no
 * use for a session's lifecycle notices and no way to correlate them.
 *
 * The notification is built once, through `noticeParams()` (the sole construction point for a
 * DaemonNotice payload; see attached.ts), and the same object is both pushed to every routed
 * connection and handed to the audit sink - one `at` timestamp per emitted notice, not one per
 * recipient. `packages_changed` is profile-scoped rather than session-scoped: it reaches every
 * initialized, credential-verified connection bound by the server to the matching profile,
 * including pages which have not attached to a session.
 *
 * A notice is best-effort and `emit` never throws: callers are lifecycle paths (worker failure
 * handling, lease reclaim, shutdown) that run detached from any request, where an exception has no
 * handler and ends the daemon. A connection that refuses the frame (its endpoint measures it against
 * the protocol table and throws OUTBOUND_INVALID) or fails the push drops that one notice for that one
 * connection and leaves an audit record; the other connections and the caller are unaffected.
