 * The one long-lived, mutable resource cell a worker process owns, created once by `runWorker()` and

 *
 * That reference sharing is the whole point, and it is load-bearing for correctness rather than a
 * convenience: `resource.stale` and the `run` it is meant to affect are two different frames handled
 * by two different, concurrently-live `dispatch()` calls, and `run`'s call stays awaited for the full
 * duration of the turn. Anything that copies these fields into a per-frame object and writes the copy
 * back once the command finishes loses every write another command made in the meantime - a
 * `resource.stale` that lands mid-turn would be reverted by the overlapped turn's write-back the
 * instant that turn ended, and silently discarded (the daemon already ACKed it, so nothing retries).
 * Mutating this object in place has no such window: there is only ever one copy of the truth.
 *
 * `staleMarks`/`reloadedMarks` are monotonic counters rather than a single "stale since" timestamp so
 * that a notice arriving *during* a reload is never mistaken for the one that reload is consuming:
 * `run` records the exact mark count it observed before reloading and only advances `reloadedMarks`
 * to that same value on success, leaving any newer notice still pending for the next turn. Two
 * notices within one millisecond are distinguishable this way; two `Date.now()` stamps are not.
 *
 * `runAdmissions` supplies a worker-wide safe point for Host resource replacement while preserving
 * parallel turns between reloads. `reloadInFlight` records the exact stale mark captured by the one
 * reload attempt that owns an admission batch, so marks received after that attempt started remain
 * pending for a later turn.

 *
 * `run`'s `AbortController` is keyed by `params.runId` in `o.aborts` for the duration of the call
 * only — `abort` looks it up by the same key and triggers it, which `HostSession.run()` already turns
 * into a real session abort via its own `signal` listener (packages/core/src/step/session.ts). There
 * is no per-runId state left behind either way: the `finally` below removes the entry whether `run`
 * finished on its own or was cut short.
 *
 * `setPreset`/`setModel` go through `o.host.validatePresetSwitch`/`validateModelSwitch` first, not
 * a `HostSession` method the caller invokes unchecked — `Host` is the only place that can weigh a
 * switch against the actual assembly (`packages/host/src/host.ts`), and `HostSession` has no method
 * that does this check on its own.
 *
 * `decideApproval` resolves a pending ticket through `HostSession.resumeApproval` — core's session
 * has no method literally named `decideApproval`; that name is this command's, not core's.
 *
 * `resource.stale`/`run`'s reload check implement next-turn reload: a `resource.stale` notification from the daemon only bumps
 * `o.resources.staleMarks` and returns immediately — it does no reload work of its own, on purpose, so
 * a notification arriving mid-turn cannot do anything on that turn's critical path. The reload itself
 * is claimed by the *next* `run`, which blocks later run admissions, waits for every earlier session
 * turn to finish, and reloads before its own `session.run()` begins. The triggering turn therefore
 * sees the refreshed resource set from its first step or proceeds on the old one after a failed
 * reload, without revoking resources underneath another active session.
 *
 * Both of those writes land on `o.resources`, the caller's own long-lived `WorkerResourceSlot` object
 * (see its doc comment) — never on a per-command copy. The notification and the `run` that consumes it
 * are separate frames dispatched concurrently, and `run` stays awaited for the whole turn, so a
 * per-command copy written back afterwards would revert whatever the overlapping notification wrote.

 *
 * MCP (stage 2b step 3): the snapshot's servers are applied as Host rows, one per server

 * generation holds none, and applying rows is idempotent against the snapshot: a retry after a later
 * failure re-applies the same rows and changes nothing. A missing snapshot means no MCP servers.
 *
 * Skills: `agnes/skills` is reloaded with the new generation, and its `loaded` flag is checked
 * explicitly — `reloadEcosystemExtension`'s own `managed.load()` resolves with `{ loaded: false,
 * error }` rather than throwing (packages/host/src/ext-host/managed-host.ts), so a silent failure
 * would otherwise be missed. `tool_search`'s Skill listing (agnes/mcp-search) reads whatever
 * generation agnes/skills serves, so nothing else needs reloading (design §3.9, D123).
 *
 * On failure the new generation is closed, never adopted. Closing it only closes its (empty) MCP
 * manager: MCP rows are independent of it. Staleness stays set so every later turn retries — so
 * skipping the close would leak one generation per retried turn.

/**
 * A skill scan/removal scoped to one daemon-resolved workspace root, run inside whatever worker
 * already holds this process (design §3.5) instead of a dedicated skill-scan worker. Builds one
 * throwaway resource generation via `bootstrapWorkerResources({..., cwd, mcpRows: true})`: `mcpRows`
 * forces `managedMcp` empty, so this generation stages and connects no MCP server, and its own
 * fresh `createSkillCandidateRegistry` + `ExtensionActivationBarrier` never touch the worker's real
 * `resourceSlot.generation` or its mounted Host rows - the daemon-visible resident view is
 * untouched, exactly as the design's "不碰会话视图" requires. The revision returned is the sha256 of
 * whatever `AGNES_RESOURCE_SNAPSHOT` bytes this call actually read, which is what makes the
 * mismatch check below meaningful: a concurrent write between the daemon computing its own expected
 * revision and this call landing is a real race, not a bug, and must fail rather than silently
 * answer from a snapshot the daemon no longer recognizes.
