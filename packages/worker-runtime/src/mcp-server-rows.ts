/**
 * Derives one Host-owned `ext:` row per non-OAuth MCP server in a snapshot (stage 2b step 3, D102/
 * D107'). Pure: the same `entries` (by value) always derives the same `rows`/`skipped` -- every
 * field of the returned `DynamicExtension`s is computed from `entries` and `opener` alone, and
 * `opener` is definition-agnostic (one instance serves every row, see `McpServerOpener`'s own doc
 * comment), so it never makes two calls with the same input diverge. A row's `factory` closure is a
 * fresh function value each call (functions cannot be identity-compared for "did this derive the
 * same row"), but its own behavior is fully determined by the same inputs.
 *
 * Which servers become rows is exactly which servers the resource manager would connect
 * (`resource-control-runtime/src/mcp.ts` `connectManaged`): `desired === 'enabled'` and
 * `trust === 'trusted'`. OAuth-bound definitions are also filtered out here, not deferred to the
 * opener: design §3.4 (D105/D109) -- OAuth is not supported by this path.
 *
 * Per-server precheck (design §3.1 "逐服务器预检"): each definition is re-validated against the
 * protocol schema; one that fails is skipped with a reason and never turns the rest of the batch --
 * let alone the tree -- into a failure. (`assertPublishableRows`, the other half of that precheck,
 * inspects row `config`; these rows never carry one, see below.)
 *
 * **Update one row, never the whole tree.** A row never carries a `config`: the definition lives only
 * in the factory's closure, and an edit surfaces as a new `revision` -> `spec.revision` ->
 * `entryRevision` -> mount identity (plugin-runtime's `buildMountIdentity`). `canReuseRowImporter`
 * (host/src/runtime-target-publisher.ts) lets an identity change through the live-tree transaction,
 * so only that server's row is swapped. A row that instead changed its `config` under an unchanged
 * identity would hit the `builtin:` config-equality check there and fall back to a full rebuild --
 * which is why the caller must `prepare()` these rows without a `config` (host/test/assemble/
 * ext-rows-dynamic.test.ts pins both shapes). The extension id itself stays stable per server
 * (`hash8(serverId)`), so an edit is a replace of the same row id, not a remove plus an add.
