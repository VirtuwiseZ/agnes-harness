/**
 * The one place in this package that knows the on-disk shape of an Agnes home directory. Two call
 * sites once computed dataDir differently -- one treated the home root itself as the default, the
 * other defaulted to `home/data` -- and a machine that hit both ended up with two parallel session
 * trees, neither one aware the other existed. Routing every caller through here instead of letting
 * each one join its own strings is what keeps that from happening again: nobody downstream has
 * enough of the layout in view to reconstruct it, so nobody can reconstruct it differently.
 *
 * The home root is a container, not a workspace. `dataDir` and `cacheDir` are always one level
 * below it, never the root itself. This design prevents accidental parallel session trees when
 * different processes compute paths differently.
